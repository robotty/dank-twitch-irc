## Usage

```javascript
const { ChatClient } = require("dank-twitch-irc");

let client = new ChatClient();

client.on("ready", () => console.log("Successfully connected to chat"));
client.on("close", (error) => {
  if (error != null) {
    console.error("Client closed due to error", error);
  }
});

client.on("PRIVMSG", (msg) => {
  console.log(`[#${msg.channelName}] ${msg.displayName}: ${msg.messageText}`);
});

// See below for more events

client.connect();
client.join("forsen");
```

## Available client events

- **`client.on("connecting", () => { /* ... */ })`**: Called when the client
  starts connecting for the first time.
- **`client.on("connect", () => { /* ... */ })`**: Called when the client
  connects for the first time. This is called when the transport layer
  connections (e.g. TCP or WebSocket connection is established), not when login
  to IRC succeeds.
- **`client.on("ready", () => { /* ... */ })`**: Called when the client becomes
  ready for the first time (login to the chat server is successful.)
- **`client.on("close", (error?: Error) => { /* ... */ })`**: Called when the
  client is terminated as a whole. Not called for individual connections that
  were disconnected. Can be caused for example by a invalid OAuth token (failure
  to login), or when `client.close()` or `client.destroy()` was called. `error`
  is only non-null if the client was closed by a call to `client.close()`.
- **`client.on("error", (error: Error?) => { /* ... */ })`**: Called when any
  error occurs on the client, including non-fatal errors such as a message that
  could not be delivered due to an error.
- **`client.on("rawCommand", (cmd: string) => { /* ... */ })`**: Called when any
  command is executed by the client.
- **`client.on("message", (message: IRCMessage) => { /* ... */ })`**: Called on
  every incoming message. If the message is a message that is further parsed (I
  called these "twitch messages" in this library) then the `message` passed to
  this handler will already be the specific type, e.g. `PrivmsgMessage` if the
  command is `PRIVMSG`.
- **`client.on("PRIVMSG", (message: PrivmsgMessage) => { /* ... */ })`**: Called
  on incoming messages whose command is `PRIVMSG`. The `message` parameter is
  always instanceof `PrivmsgMessage`. (See the API documentation for what
  properties exist on all `PrivmsgMessage` instances)

  For example:

  ```javascript
  client.on("CLEARCHAT", (msg) => {
    if (msg.isTimeout()) {
      console.log(
        `${msg.targetUsername} just got timed out for ` +
          `${msg.banDuration} seconds in channel ${msg.channelName}`
      );
    }
  });
  ```

  Other message types that have specific message parsing are:

  - **`CLEARCHAT`** (maps to [`ClearchatMessage`][clearchat]) - Timeout and ban
    messages
  - **`CLEARMSG`** (maps to [`ClearmsgMessage`][clearmsg]) - Single message
    deletions (initiated by `/delete`)
  - **`HOSTTARGET`** (maps to [`HosttargetMessage`][hosttarget]) - A channel
    entering or exiting host mode.
  - **`NOTICE`** (maps to [`NoticeMessage`][notice]) - Various notices, such as
    when you `/help`, a command fails, the error response when you are timed
    out, etc.
  - **`PRIVMSG`** (maps to [`PrivmsgMessage`][privmsg]) - Normal chat messages
  - **`ROOMSTATE`** (maps to [`RoomstateMessage`][roomstate]) - A change to a
    channel's followers mode, subscribers-only mode, r9k mode, followers mode,
    slow mode etc.
  - **`USERNOTICE`** (maps to [`UsernoticeMessage`][usernotice]) - Subs, resubs,
    sub gifts, rituals, raids, etc. - See more details about how to handle this
    message type below.
  - **`USERSTATE`** (maps to [`UserstateMessage`][userstate]) - Your own state
    (e.g. badges, color, display name, emote sets, mod status), sent on every
    time you join a channel or send a `PRIVMSG` to a channel
  - **`GLOBALUSERSTATE`** (maps to
    [`GlobaluserstateMessage`][globaluserstate]) - Logged in user's "global
    state", sent once on every login (Note that due to the used connection pool
    you can receive this multiple times during your bot's runtime)
  - **`WHISPER`** (maps to [`WhisperMessage`][whisper]) - Somebody else
    whispering you
  - **`JOIN`** (maps to [`JoinMessage`][join]) - You yourself joining a channel,
    of if you have `requestMembershipCapability` enabled, also other users
    joining channels you are joined to.
  - **`PART`** (maps to [`JoinMessage`][part]) - You yourself parting (leaving)
    a channel, of if you have `requestMembershipCapability` enabled, also other
    users parting channels you are joined to.
  - **`RECONNECT`** (maps to [`ReconnectMessage`][reconnect]) - When the twitch
    server tells a client to reconnect and re-join channels (You don't have to
    listen for this yourself, this is done automatically already)
  - **`PING`** (maps to [`PingMessage`][ping]) - When the twitch server sends a
    ping, expecting a pong back from the client to verify if the connection is
    still alive. (You don't have to listen for this yourself, the client
    automatically responds for you)
  - **`PONG`** (maps to [`PongMessage`][pong]) - When the twitch server responds
    to our `PING` requests (The library automatically sends a `PING` request
    every 30 seconds to verify connections are alive)
  - **`CAP`** (maps to [`CapMessage`][cap]) - Message type received once during
    connection startup, acknowledging requested capabilities.

All other commands (if they don't have a special parsed type like the ones
listed above) will still be emitted under their command name as an
[`IRCMessage`][ircmessage], e.g.:

```javascript
// :tmi.twitch.tv 372 botfactory :You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.
// msg will be an instance of IRCMessage
client.on("372", (msg) =>
  console.log(`Server MOTD is: ${msg.ircParameters[1]}`)
);
```

## Handling `USERNOTICE` messages

The `USERNOTICE` message type is special because it encapsulates a wide range of
events, including:

- Subs
- Resubs
- Gift subscription
- Incoming raid and
- Channel rituals,

which are all emitted under the `USERNOTICE` event. See also
[the offical documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/tags/#usernotice-twitch-tags)
about the `USERNOTICE` command.

Every `USERNOTICE` message is sent by a user, and always contains a
`msg.systemMessage` (This is a message that twitch formats for you, e.g.
`4 raiders from PotehtoO have joined!` for a `raid` message.) Additionally,
every `USERNOTICE` message can have a message that is additionally sent/shared
from the sending user, for example the "share this message with the streamer"
message sent with resubs and subs. If no message is sent by the user,
`msg.messageText` is `undefined`.

`dank-twitch-irc` currently does not have special parsing code for each
`USERNOTICE` `messageTypeID` (e.g. `sub`, `resub`, `raid`, etc...) - Instead the
parser assigns all `msg-param-` tags to the `msg.eventParams` object. See below
on what `msg.eventParams` are available for each of the `messageTypeID`s.

### Sub and resub

When a user subscribes or resubscribes with his own money/prime (this is NOT
sent for gift subs, see below)

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  // sub and resub messages have the same parameters, so we can handle them both the same way
  if (!msg.isSub() && !msg.isResub()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   *
   * {
   *   "cumulativeMonths": 10,
   *   "cumulativeMonthsRaw": "10",
   *   "subPlan": "1000", // Prime, 1000, 2000 or 3000
   *   "subPlanName": "The Ninjas",
   *
   *   // if shouldShareStreak is false, then
   *   // streakMonths/streakMonthsRaw will be 0
   *   // (the user did not share their sub streak in chat)
   *   "shouldShareStreak": true,
   *   "streakMonths": 7,
   *   "streakMonthsRaw": "7"
   * }
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user subbing/resubbing.
   */

  if (msg.isSub()) {
    // Leppunen just subscribed to ninja with a tier 1000 (The Ninjas) sub for the first time!
    console.log(
      msg.displayName +
        " just subscribed to " +
        msg.channelName +
        " with a tier " +
        msg.eventParams.subPlan +
        " (" +
        msg.eventParams.subPlanName +
        ") sub for the first time!"
    );
  } else if (msg.isResub()) {
    let streakMessage = "";
    if (msg.eventParams.shouldShareStreak) {
      streakMessage =
        ", currently " + msg.eventParams.streakMonths + " months in a row";
    }

    // Leppunen just resubscribed to ninja with a tier 1000 (The Ninjas) sub!
    // They are resubscribing for 10 months, currently 7 months in a row!
    console.log(
      msg.displayName +
        " just resubscribed to " +
        msg.channelName +
        " with a tier " +
        msg.eventParams.subPlan +
        " (" +
        msg.eventParams.subPlanName +
        ") sub! They are resubscribing for " +
        msg.eventParams.cumulativeMonths +
        " months" +
        streakMessage +
        "!"
    );
  }

  if (msg.messageText != null) {
    // you also have access to lots of other properties also present on PRIVMSG messages,
    // such as msg.badges, msg.senderUsername, msg.badgeInfo, msg.bits/msg.isCheer(),
    // msg.color, msg.emotes, msg.messageID, msg.serverTimestamp, etc...
    console.log(
      msg.displayName +
        " shared the following message with the streamer: " +
        msg.messageText
    );
  } else {
    console.log("They did not share a message with the streamer.");
  }
});
```

### Incoming raids

Twitch says:

> Incoming raid to a channel. Raid is a Twitch tool that allows broadcasters to
> send their viewers to another channel, to help support and grow other members
> in the community.)

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isRaid()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * {
   *   "displayName": "Leppunen",
   *   "login": "leppunen",
   *   "viewerCount": 12,
   *   "viewerCountRaw": "12"
   * }
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user raiding this channel.
   * Note that the display name and login present in msg.eventParams are
   * the same as msg.displayName and msg.senderUsername, so it doesn't matter
   * which one you use (although I recommend the properties directly on the
   * message object, not in eventParams)
   */

  // source user is the channel/streamer raiding
  // Leppunen just raided Supinic with 12 viewers!
  console.log(
    msg.displayName +
      " just raided " +
      msg.channelName +
      " with " +
      msg.eventParams.viewerCount +
      " viewers!"
  );
});
```

### Subgift

When a user gifts somebody else a subscription.

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isSubgift()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * {
   *   "months": 5,
   *   "monthsRaw": "5",
   *   "giftMonths": 5,
   *   "giftMonthsRaw": "5",
   *   "recipientDisplayName": "Leppunen",
   *   "recipientID": "42239452",
   *   "recipientUsername": "leppunen",
   *   "subPlan": "1000",
   *   "subPlanName": "The Ninjas",
   *   "senderCount": 5,
   *   "senderCountRaw": "5",
   * }
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user gifting the subscription.
   */

  if (msg.eventParams.months === 1) {
    // Leppunen just gifted NymN a fresh tier 1000 (The Ninjas) sub to ninja!
    console.log(
      msg.displayName +
        " just gifted " +
        msg.eventParams.recipientDisplayName +
        " a fresh tier " +
        msg.eventParams.subPlan +
        " (" +
        msg.eventParams +
        ") sub to " +
        msg.channelName +
        "!"
    );
  } else {
    // Leppunen just gifted NymN a tier 1000 (The Ninjas) resub to ninja, that's 7 months in a row!
    console.log(
      msg.displayName +
        " just gifted " +
        msg.eventParams.recipientDisplayName +
        " a tier " +
        msg.eventParams.subPlan +
        " (" +
        msg.eventParams +
        ") resub to " +
        msg.channelName +
        ", that's " +
        msg.eventParams.months +
        " in a row!"
    );
  }

  // note: if the subgift was from an anonymous user, the sender user for the USERNOTICE message will be
  // AnAnonymousGifter (user ID 274598607)
  if (msg.senderUserID === "274598607") {
    console.log("That (re)sub was gifted anonymously!");
  }
});
```

### Anonsubgift

When an anonymous user gifts a subscription to a viewer.

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isAnonSubgift()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * {
   *   "months": 5,
   *   "monthsRaw": "5",
   *   "recipientDisplayName": "Leppunen",
   *   "recipientID": "42239452",
   *   "recipientUsername": "leppunen",
   *   "subPlan": "1000",
   *   "subPlanName": "The Ninjas"
   * }
   *
   * WARNING! Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the broadcaster (e.g. Ninja
   * in the example below)
   */

  if (msg.eventParams.months === 1) {
    // An anonymous gifter just gifted NymN a fresh tier 1000 (The Ninjas) sub to ninja!
    console.log(
      "An anonymous gifter just gifted " +
        msg.eventParams.recipientDisplayName +
        " a fresh tier " +
        msg.eventParams.subPlan +
        " (" +
        msg.eventParams +
        ") sub to " +
        msg.channelName +
        "!"
    );
  } else {
    // An anonymous gifter just gifted NymN a tier 1000 (The Ninjas) resub to ninja, that's 7 months in a row!
    console.log(
      "An anonymous gifter just gifted " +
        msg.eventParams.recipientDisplayName +
        " a tier " +
        msg.eventParams.subPlan +
        " (" +
        msg.eventParams +
        ") resub to " +
        msg.channelName +
        ", that's " +
        msg.eventParams.months +
        " in a row!"
    );
  }
});
```

### anongiftpaidupgrade, giftpaidupgrade

When a user commits to continue the gift sub by another user (or an anonymous
gifter).

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isAnonGiftPaidUpgrade()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * EITHER: (ONLY when a promotion is running!)
   * {
   *   "promoName": "Subtember 2018",
   *   "promoGiftTotal": 3987234,
   *   "promoGiftTotalRaw": "3987234"
   * }
   * OR: (when no promotion is running)
   * {}
   *
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user continuing their sub.
   */

  // Leppunen is continuing their ninja gift sub they got from an anonymous user!
  console.log(
    msg.displayName +
      " is continuing their " +
      msg.channelName +
      " gift sub they got from an anonymous user!"
  );
});
```

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isGiftPaidUpgrade()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * EITHER: (ONLY when a promotion is running!)
   * {
   *   "promoName": "Subtember 2018",
   *   "promoGiftTotal": 3987234,
   *   "promoGiftTotalRaw": "3987234",
   *   "senderLogin": "krakenbul",
   *   "senderName": "Krakenbul"
   * }
   * OR: (when no promotion is running)
   * {
   *   "senderLogin": "krakenbul",
   *   "senderName": "Krakenbul"
   * }
   *
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user continuing their sub.
   */

  // Leppunen is continuing their ninja gift sub they got from Krakenbul!
  console.log(
    msg.displayName +
      " is continuing their " +
      msg.channelName +
      " gift sub they got from " +
      msg.msgParam.senderName +
      "!"
  );
});
```

### ritual

Channel ritual. Twitch says:

> Channel _ritual_. Many channels have special rituals to celebrate viewer
> milestones when they are shared. The rituals notice extends the sharing of
> these messages to other viewer milestones (initially, a new viewer chatting
> for the first time).

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isRitual()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * {
   *   "ritualName": "new_chatter"
   * }
   *
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user performing the
   * ritual (e.g. the new chatter).
   */

  // Leppunen is new to ninja's chat! Say hello!
  if (msg.eventParams.ritualName === "new_chatter") {
    console.log(
      msg.displayName + " is new to " + msg.channelName + "'s chat! Say hello!"
    );
  } else {
    console.warn(
      "Unknown (unhandled) ritual type: " + msg.eventParams.ritualName
    );
  }
});
```

### bitsbadgetier

When a user cheers and earns himself a new bits badge with that cheer (e.g. they
just cheered more than/exactly 10000 bits in total, and just earned themselves
the 10k bits badge)

```javascript
chatClient.on("USERNOTICE", (msg) => {
  if (!msg.isBitsBadgeTier()) {
    return;
  }

  /*
   * msg.eventParams are:
   * {
   *   "threshold": 10000,
   *   "thresholdRaw": "10000",
   * }
   *
   * Sender user of the USERNOTICE message is the user cheering the bits.
   */

  // Leppunen just earned themselves the 10000 bits badge in ninja's channel!
  console.log(
    msg.displayName +
      " just earned themselves the " +
      msg.threshold +
      " bits badge in " +
      msg.channelName +
      "'s channel!"
  );
});
```

## ChatClient API

You probably will want to use these functions on `ChatClient` most frequently:

- `client.join(channelName: string): Promise<void>` - Join (Listen to) the
  channel given by the channel name
- `client.joinAll(channelNames: string[]): Promise<void>` - Join (Listen to) all
  of the listed channels at once (bulk join)
- `client.part(channelName: string): Promise<void>` - Part (Leave/Unlisten) the
  channel given by the channel name
- `client.privmsg(channelName: string, message: string): Promise<void>` - Send a
  raw `PRIVMSG` to the given channel. You can issue chat commands with this
  function, e.g. `client.privmsg("forsen", "/timeout weeb123 5")` or normal
  messages, e.g. `client.privmsg("forsen", "Kappa Keepo PogChamp")`.
- `client.say(channelName: string, message: string): Promise<void>` - Say a
  normal chat message in the given channel. If a command is given as `message`,
  it will be escaped.
- `client.me(channelName: string, message: string): Promise<void>` - Post a
  `/me` message in the given channel.
- `client.timeout(channelName: string, username: string, length: number, reason?: string): Promise<void>` -
  Timeout `username` for `length` seconds in `channelName`. Optionally accepts a
  reason to set.
- `client.ping()` - Send a `PING` on a connection from the pool, and awaits the
  `PONG` response. You can use this to measure server latency, for example.
- `client.whisper(username: string, message: string)` - Send the user a whisper
  from the bot.
- `client.setColor(color: Color)` - set the username color of your bot account.
  E.g. `client.setColor({ r: 255, g: 0, b: 127 })`.
- `client.getMods(channelName: string)` and `client.getVips(channelName: string)` -
  Get a list of moderators/VIPs in a channel. Returns
  a promise that resolves to an array of strings (login names of the moderators/VIPs).
  Note that due to Twitch's restrictions, this function cannot be used with anonymous chat clients.
  (The request will time out if your chat client is logged in as anonymous.)

Extra functionality:

- `client.sendRaw(command: string): void` - Send a raw IRC command to a
  connection in the connection pool.
- `client.unconnected (boolean)` - Returns whether the client is unconnected.
- `client.connecting (boolean)` - Returns whether the client is connecting.
- `client.connected (boolean)` - Returns whether the client is connected
  (Transport layer is connected).
- `client.ready (boolean)` - Returns whether the client is ready (Logged into
  IRC server).
- `client.closed (boolean)` - Returns whether the client is closed.

Note that channel names in the above functions always refer to the "login name"
of a twitch channel. Channel names may not be capitalized, e.g. `Forsen` would
be invalid, but `forsen` not. This library also does not accept the leading `#`
character and never returns it on any message objects (e.g. `msg.channelName`
would be `forsen`, not `#forsen`).

## Client options

Pass options to the `ChatClient` constructor. More available options are
documented in the Below are all possible options and their default values:

**Note! ALL of these configuration options are _optional_!** I highly recommend you
only set the very config options you need, the rest are usually at a reasonable default.  
For most bots, you only need to set `username` and `password`:

```javascript
let client = new ChatClient({
  username: "your-bot-username",
  password: "0123456789abcdef1234567",
});
```

Nevertheless, here are examples of all possible config options:

```javascript
let client = new ChatClient({
  username: "your-bot-username", // justinfan12345 by default - For anonymous chat connection
  password: "0123456789abcdef1234567", // undefined by default (no password)

  // Message rate limits configuration for verified and known bots
  // pick one of the presets or configure custom rates as shown below:
  rateLimits: "default",
  // or:
  rateLimits: "knownBot",
  // or:
  rateLimits: "verifiedBot",
  // or:
  rateLimits: {
    highPrivmsgLimits: 100,
    lowPrivmsgLimits: 20,
  },

  // Configuration options for the backing connections:
  // Plain TCP or TLS
  connection: {
    type: "tcp", // tcp by default

## Features

This client currently supports the following features:

- Connection pooling and round-robin connection usage
- Automatic rate limiter for connection opening and chat commands
- All twitch-specific message types parsed (`CLEARCHAT`, `CLEARMSG`,
  `GLOBALUSERSTATE`, `HOSTTARGET`, `JOIN`, `NOTICE`, `PART`, `PING`, `PONG`,
  `PRIVMSG`, `RECONNECT`, `ROOMSTATE`, `USERNOTICE`, `USERSTATE`, `WHISPER`,
  `CAP`)
- Accurate response to server responses (e.g. error thrown if you are banned
  from channel/channel is suspended/login is invalid etc.)
- Bulk join functionality to join lots of channels quickly
- Implements the recommended connection control, utilizing `RECONNECT`, `PING`
  and `PONG`
- Full tracking of room state (e.g. submode, emote-only mode, followers mode,
  r9k etc.) and user state (badges, moderator state, color, etc).
- Most function calls return promises but errors can also be handled by
  subscribing to the error event
- Slow-mode rate limiter for non-VIP/moderator bots (waits either the global
  ~1.3 sec/channel-specific slow mode)
- Support for different types of transport (in-memory, TCP, WebSocket)

## Extra Mixins

There are some features you might find useful in your bot that are not necessary
for general client/bot operations, so they were packaged as **mixins**. You can
activate mixins by calling:

```javascript
const { ChatClient, AlternateMessageModifier } = require("dank-twitch-irc");

let client = new ChatClient();

client.use(new AlternateMessageModifier(client));
```

Available mixins are:

- `new AlternateMessageModifier(client)` will allow your bot to send the same
  message within a 30 seconds period. You must also use `client.say` and
  `client.me` for this mixin to behave consistently and reliably.
- `new SlowModeRateLimiter(client, /* optional */ maxWaitingMessages)` will rate
  limit your messages in channels where your bot is not moderator, VIP or
  broadcaster and has to wait a bit between sending messages. If more than
  `maxWaitingMessages` are waiting, the outgoing message will be dropped
  silently. `maxWaitingMessages` defaults to 10. Note this mixin only has an
  effect on `client.say` and `client.me` functions, not `client.privmsg`.

and the mixins installed by default:

- `new PrivmsgMessageRateLimiter(client)` - Rate limits outgoing messages
  according to the rate limits imposed by Twitch. Configure the verified/known
  status of your bot using the config (see above).
- `new ConnectionRateLimiter(client)` - Rate limits new connections accoding to
  the rate limits set in the config.
- `new UserStateTracker(client)` - Used by other mixins. Keeps track of what
  state your bot user has in all channels.
- `new RoomStateTracker()` - Used by other mixins. Keeps track of each channel's
  state, e.g. sub-mode etc.
- `new IgnoreUnhandledPromiseRejectionsMixin()` - Silences
  `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning`s on promises returned by the client's
  functions. (installed for you if you activate the
  `ignoreUnhandledPromiseRejections` client option)
